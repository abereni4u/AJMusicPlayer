For each file in the directory, if file extension ends with .wav, .mp3, or .flac, add the file name to an array.

<li>
Print out each file found in the array.

<li>
If array is empty, print no music files found.

Alright a little more complicated than we thought. I'm trying to "stretch my capacity" and do things a little differently this time around by
trying to use AI as little as possible. I'm reading documentation only then testing and adjusting based on what screws up. Today I figured out how to validate whether 
a given string is a valid directory. I'm immediately getting a better hands-on understanding of how OOP works. I needed to convert the string into a Path, so that 
I could use that Path in the Files method that returns a boolean if the Path is a directory. Noticed I was copy and pasting a lot so I made methods for those. 
Its only Day 1 of actually coding it out and I already just want to keep going. I didn't consider the case where someone inputs a string with spaces in between the 
characters, so I'm going to add a check for that later. Of course, when I get to the UI part, then this feature I'm implementing will be a popup box where they just
click and choose a directory as in normal programs. I'm just getting the basic functionality down, seeing what data I'll need and how it needs to be processed, and THEN, when
everything is solid, I'll start the UI design. It's getting late so I have to stop here.

Completed the music file retrieval process today. The Files and Path classes are super helpful. I think most of what I'll need for directory access will be there. Now that this part of the program is done I think the next part is figuring out the actual structure I want to have for this program. Once again I'm not worrying about UI yet, at this point, I'm just working out how the data is gonna be manipulated and stored. I'll just be adding more to the TASKS section of this document and also create a new SYSTEM design section next session. Before I close off tonight gonna try to clean up the code I have written since it's getting a bit messy. Gonna be looking at a few music players I've got on my PC to figure out what kind of absolute basic features I want to have before expanding to the cooler stuff down the line, like visualizations. 
</p>

<div id="Local Media Player Notes-Entries-11/19/2025"><h3 id="11/19/2025" class="header"><a href="#Local Media Player Notes-Entries-11/19/2025">11/19/2025</a></h3></div>
<p>
Started fleshing out the system design for the program a bit. I wasn't sure how to start, so I made up a scenario of a first time use. What would need to happen? What files need to be created? How will different objects and classes interact with each other? Writing out a scenario and detailing what would be happening in the background has made it a lot more clear what I need to do. I was thinking about the program earlier in the day and I think, along with cool visualizations, I also want to have a mode for slick animations that play whenever we get to the next song. Something that allows me to use my motion graphic skills and also because at least in my head right now it seems like a sick idea. I also have ideas for UI that suit my specific tastes at the very least. Once again these will be further down the line but I have some ways I can make this music player stand out a little bit. There's still some more planning to do but the next thing I want to implement is just storing my directory in a file and reading from it when I launch the program again. That'll be the beginning and where we really start from. When going about writing the background details in the scenario I created, I was thinking this may be an opportunity to use Java serialization? I need a way to store the user's Music Library and load it up everytime. I'll have to look into caching and see how that's done because I think loading the whole library every time we launch would be pretty slow and extra work for no reason.
